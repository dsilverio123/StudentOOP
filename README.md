# Simplified Student Management System - C++ School Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a small-scale C++ project developed as part of a school assignment. The project is a console application that emulates a basic student management system, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts in C++ and the principles of object-oriented design.

### Features
- Utilization of basic C++ constructs and syntax.
- Implementation of object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, objects, and inheritance.
- Management of student data, such as names, IDs, email addresses, ages, course enrollments, and associated degree programs.
- Functionalities to add, update, delete, and display student records.

### Learning Objectives
- To demonstrate understanding and proficiency in C++ programming.
- To gain practical experience in object-oriented design in C++.
- To implement and manage data within a C++ application.
